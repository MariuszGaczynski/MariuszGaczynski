Examples of my C# solutions

This are selected solutions that I've already made. Most of them where made as my "home work" during .NET and C# course that I participated in at may and april 2020.
Nothing fancy, no rocket science. Just a basics of C# language that I learned and now I am familiar with and have understanding of it. I start from the top with the newest and probably more complex ones (for my coding skills level, of course ;)).
