Examples of my C# solutions

This are selected solutions that I've already made. Most of them where made as my "home work" during .NET and C# course that I participated in at may and april 2020.
Nothing fancy, no rocket science. Just a basics of C# language that I learned and now I am familiar with and have understanding of it. I start from the top with the newest and probably more complex ones (for my coding skills level, of course ;)).

# [One Player Battleship Game](https://github.com/MariuszGaczynski/Zadanie20_Statki/tree/master/Zadanie20_Statki)
###### Application is a classic Battleship game for one player made in Windows Forms. Battleships are deployed automatically on a 10X10 game board.

# [Resistors Color Code Calculator](https://github.com/MariuszGaczynski/Zadanie15_Rezystory/tree/master/Zadanie15_Rezystory)
###### It is Windows Forms application that can calculate electric resistant of resistors by decoding its colorful bands. By providing application with particular colors of band that are displayed on a resistor you can see what is their electrical resistance and a tolerance of that value.


# [Weights, Measures, Distances - Converter](https://github.com/MariuszGaczynski/Zadanie17_WagiMiaryPredkosci/tree/master/Zadanie17_WagiMiaryPredkosci)
###### Very simple calculator that can convert some measures, wights and distances between different systems. Converter was made as Windows Forms application.


# [When was/is/would be Easter Sunday ???](https://github.com/MariuszGaczynski/Zadanie7_DataWielkanocy/tree/master/Zadanie7_DataWielkanocy)

###### This Console application can convert numbers written in Arabic numerals (like for example: 1, 4, 17, 36)  to Roman numerals (like for example: I, IV, VII, XXXVI)  and vice versa.


# [PESEL Number Checker](https://github.com/MariuszGaczynski/Zadanie10_NumerPESEL/tree/master/Zadanie10_NumerPESEL)
###### Console application that can distinguish if given PESEL number is a valid one. PESEL identification number consists of numbers that represents birth date and sex of its owner, and a control number by which you can determine if it is real.


# [Integer Numbers Sequence Analyzer](https://github.com/MariuszGaczynski/Zadanie12_AnalizaLiczb/tree/master/Zadanie12_AnalizaLiczb)
###### By this Console application you can analyze a string of numbers. It can calculate an average, median, mode, standard deviation and maximum and minimum value of numbers provided by user.


# [Seeking for Prime Numbers](https://github.com/MariuszGaczynski/Zadanie3_LiczbyPierwsze/tree/master/Zadanie3_LiczbyPierwsze)
###### This Console application can check if given number is a prime number. It also displays prime numbers preceding the one that was found.
